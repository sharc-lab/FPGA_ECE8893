/*
 * Impl. of the 3-opt heuristic. Tries to change the order of nodes in
 * solution to shorten the travel distance.
 *
 * During the search for an improvement only edges connecting nn_count nearest
 * neighbors are taken into account to cut the overall search time.
 *
 * The solution's route is modified only if a better order was found.
 *
 * Function returns improvement over the previous route length (travel
 * distance).
 *
 * This implementation is based on the ideas proposed in:
 * Bentley, Jon Jouis. "Fast algorithms for geometric traveling
 * salesman problems." ORSA Journal on computing 4.4 (1992): 387-411.
 *
 * Returns a number of changes (moves) applied to the route.
